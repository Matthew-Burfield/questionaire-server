Questionaire server

15-Feb - Spent some time trying to connect to the database created by docker. No luck yet
17-Feb - Played around with prisma trying to get the local docker sql server integrated. No luck yet as I keep running into typescript errors. Plan is to fallback to javascript for now and get it working, then try and migrate back to typescript.
18-Feb - Tried starting from scratch without typescript. Haven't got the server to be able to start yet.
22-Feb - Yesterday got the server working properly with typescript and using the local docker database. Frontend now links up too with query and mutations
23 Feb - Spent some time this morning trying to set up a sql server that I can link the production env to
24 Feb - Didn't actually do anything today but want to keep the streak alive!
