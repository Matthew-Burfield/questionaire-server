Questionaire server

15-Feb - Spent some time trying to connect to the database created by docker. No luck yet
17-Feb - Played around with prisma trying to get the local docker sql server integrated. No luck yet as I keep running into typescript errors. Plan is to fallback to javascript for now and get it working, then try and migrate back to typescript.
